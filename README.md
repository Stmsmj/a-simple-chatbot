# a simple chatbot
this is a chatbot powered by [hugging face model](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) that got trained on persona-chat dataset which makes model able to have and talk with a personality and you can change that personality. for image classification i used [indoor dataset](https://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html) which is made of 67 classes of indoor pics.
and i added some rule-based commands like `tell me a joke` , `tell me a fun fact` and `tell me a quote`.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
if you see any error in pip installing just do it one by one

## instruction
the size of model for image classification was 3 Gigabyte so i couldn't upload it here so if you want this feature you need to train it yourself üôÇ. you can fine tune it and got a better results just make a contribution ü§ù.
if you dont want this feature just comment these lines `189,191,208-216,287,303`
